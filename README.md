# KrangTools
KrangTools is a set of scripts that can be used in text processing for OCR and NLP pipeline building.

In order to install system requirements, use the following command:
xargs -rxa requirements.txt -- sudo apt-get install --

In order to use this script, you will need to install the programs inside of requirements.txt

The file structure this works around is as follows:
```
|/root/
-|OCRd
-|foo/
--|OCR.sh
--|<.PDF files to be OCR'd>
```
