# OCR Scripts

These scripts are for OCR activation and a little bulk file management.

It may seem silly to have scripts that do simple things like moving a certain number of files from one directory to another, but with the volume of files you may be dealing with, your arguments list may be too long for processing.

## OCR.sh
Recommend you use this with tmux, especially if you're processing through a high volume of files, most especially if your files have a high number of pages in them.

## movestuff.sh
This script is helpful for moving large volumes of files from one place to another.

## striptext.sh
This script will help rip raw text out of your PDFs. It will dump raw text files out with the same name as the original file.
